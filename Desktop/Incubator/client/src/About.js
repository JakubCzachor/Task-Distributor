      <h3>Task Distributor</h3>
      <p>We are a team of 3 who have come together to build a website which uses React along with firebase for the back end that allows for users to be able to upload tasks they wish to have completed along with allowing other users to take on those tasks.</p>
      <h3>Usage</h3>
      <p>To be able to use our web app one must first register as registering allows the user to not only upload tasks but also accept tasks.</p>
      <p>Our navigation bar should allow the user to view what options we have available from being able to add,search,view requested tasks and view completed tasks.</p>
